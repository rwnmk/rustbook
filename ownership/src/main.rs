## Remember this!

Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary. Now that we know about slices, we can properly understand string literals:

let s = "Hello, world!";
The type of s here is &str: itâ€™s a slice pointing to that specific point of the binary. This is also why string literals are immutable; &str is an immutable reference.
